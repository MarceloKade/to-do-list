### Presentation

This project consists of a simple web application for task management. The interface was developed using the Bootstrap framework and the JavaScript code. The goal is to show how it is possible to create a functional application using basic and popular technologies, as well as to demonstrate techniques for manipulating HTML elements, storing data locally in the browser, and controlling keyboard events.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to create a simple, yet functional to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to add, remove, and edit tasks, as well as mark them as complete. Additionally, the application should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes. The use of the Bootstrap framework is encouraged to facilitate the development of a user-friendly interface. Learn more at: [What I learned](#what-i-learned)

### What I Learned:

#### BOOTSTRAP

- Within this project, I learned how to use Bootstrap to create a responsive and pleasant interface for the user. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-built components and styles, which speeds up the development of a website or application.

- In the project, I was able to use Bootstrap classes to style HTML tags such as buttons and forms quickly and easily. Additionally, I utilized Bootstrap's grid system to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes without the need to write custom CSS code.

- In summary, I learned that Bootstrap is a powerful and useful tool for web development. With it, you can create attractive and responsive interfaces efficiently and with minimal effort.

#### JavaScript

- In this project, I learned about the power of JavaScript and how it can be used to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

- By analyzing the code, I discovered how to manipulate the DOM, respond to user events, and make HTTP requests using JavaScript.

- I also learned how to use third-party libraries like jQuery to simplify and streamline my code. Overall, I realized that JavaScript is an essential tool for modern web development and has endless possibilities for enhancing the user experience.
